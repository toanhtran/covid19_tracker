After taking an online class through The London App Brewery on Flutter, I wanted to create a project that combined a lot of what was learned. 2020 has been an interesting year and thus was born the idea of a simple app to pull Covid-19 data for all the states and the US and have it in one location. There are currently a lot of API's available for this sort of thing, all are works in progress, and all have to pull data from a myriad of sources to supply their API's. I chose to go with The COVID Tracking Project API (currently on V1, V2 is in the works) as it's a volunteer project with people dedicated to getting the most complete data out to the public. 

This app is a work in progress, clearly, but most importantly it has been educational. The best part is that it has been FUN! Now that's my kind of project!
